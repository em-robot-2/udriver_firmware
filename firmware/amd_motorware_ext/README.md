AMD MotorWare Extensions
========================

This repository contains some modules that extend the Texas Instruments
MotorWare Library.  They are implemented such that they can be used by
different projects that are based on MotorWare.

The reason for putting this into a separate repository, instead of simply
adding it to MotorWare, is to as little changes to MotorWare as possible.  This
way it should be easier to update MotorWare in case this is needed at some
point.
